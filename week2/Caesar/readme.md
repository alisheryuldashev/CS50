This problem required to implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesarâ€™s cipher.
A user would enter a number (for example 13) and then a plain text. 
The program would encrypt that message by "rotating" each letter by k(13) position as in this example below: 

$ ./caesar 13 <br />
plaintext:  hello, world<br />
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq
