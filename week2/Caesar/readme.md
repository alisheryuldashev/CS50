This problem required to implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesarâ€™s cipher.
A user would enter a plain text and the program would encrypt that message by "rotating" each letter by k position as in this example below: 

$ ./caesar 13 <br />
plaintext:  hello, world<br />
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq
