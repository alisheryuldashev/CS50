Problem 2

Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend a "half-pyramid" of blocks before leaping (if he wants to maximize his score) toward a flag pole.

This console program written in C recreates a similar half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks. It first prompts the user for the half-pyramid’s height, a non-negative integer no greater than 23. If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, it should re-prompt for the same again. It, then, generates the desired half-pyramid and aligns the bottom-left corner of the half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window, as in the sample output below:
