In this problem I implemented an animation in MIT Scrath game where I tried to use some boolean expressions, conditions, loops, variables, threads, and events.

This was a motivational animation showing how to not give up on your dreams. It's based on my personal experience of studying programming while juggling full time work and a family with two small kids : )

And here is the link to watch it:
