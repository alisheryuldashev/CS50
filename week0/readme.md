In Week 0:Scratch I learned the following topics:

Binary.  
ASCII.  
Algorithms.  
Pseudocode.  
Source code.  
Compiler.  
Object code.  
MIT Scratch game.  
Statements.  
Boolean expressions.  
Conditions.  
Loops.  
Variables.  
Functions.  
Arrays.  
Threads.  
Events.  

In week 0 I implemented an animation in MIT Scrath game where I tried to use some boolean expressions, conditions, loops, variables, threads, and events.

This was a motivational animation showing how to not give up on your dreams. It's based on my personal experience of studying programming while juggling full time work and a family with two small kids : )

And here is the link to watch it:
