In this challenge we've already got the starter file and needed to implement the four functions to make the game work: 

1. init (to initialize the matrix) 
2. draw (to draw the matrix) 
3. move (to move the numbers) 
4. won (to show the win) 

The Game of Fifteen is a puzzle played on a square, two-dimensional board with numbered tiles that slide. 
The goal of this puzzle is to arrange the board’s tiles from smallest to largest, left to right, top to bottom, 
with an empty space in board’s bottom-right corner, as in the below.
